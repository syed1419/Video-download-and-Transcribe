            "[06:30.800 --> 06:32.400]  So you first have to check\n",
            "[06:32.400 --> 06:35.800]  if you have the Java SE development kit installed or not.\n",
            "[06:35.800 --> 06:36.900]  And here you can see\n",

            "[06:55.800 --> 06:59.700]  There is no tedious installation screen to deal with now\n",
            "[06:59.700 --> 07:01.400]  once the download is complete.\n",
            "[07:01.400 --> 07:03.800]  You can go into your downloads and find\n",
            "[07:03.800 --> 07:06.800]  that the Apache J meter file is already there\n",
            "[07:06.800 --> 07:11.400]  and inside bin you will get to see all these files of J meter.\n",
            "[07:12.300 --> 07:14.400]  Now if you are using windows,\n",
            "[07:14.400 --> 07:18.000]  you just have to run the file the J meter dot bat\n",
            "[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  to start the J meter in the GUI mode.\n",
            "[07:21.100 --> 07:24.300]  So I have already installed the J meter in my system\n",
            "[07:24.300 --> 07:27.300]  and I've also created a shortcut in the desktop.\n",
            "[07:27.300 --> 07:30.700]  So let's open this and show you how it actually looks.\n",
            "[07:31.500 --> 07:32.600]  Now you can see\n",
            "[07:32.600 --> 07:36.000]  that our Apache J meter is getting started.\n",
            "[07:36.100 --> 07:38.700]  So this is exactly how it looks.\n",

            "[07:43.900 --> 07:47.000]  We can perform the testing for any website\n",
            "[07:47.000 --> 07:49.500]  or any software program now\n",
            "[07:49.500 --> 07:52.200]  before starting any performance testing.\n",
            "[07:52.200 --> 07:54.900]  Let's discuss some of the important elements\n",
            "[07:54.900 --> 07:56.900]  that are present in the J meter.\n",
            "[07:57.300 --> 07:59.700]  Now there are four important elements\n",
            "[07:59.700 --> 08:02.600]  that are the thread group samplers listeners\n",
            "[08:02.600 --> 08:06.300]  and configurations now first we create a test plan.\n",
            "[08:06.300 --> 08:07.500]  So it is a container\n",
            "[08:07.500 --> 08:10.300]  which describes what to and how to test here.\n",
            "[08:10.300 --> 08:13.400]  You can see how it looks like just how I have shown you\n",
            "[08:13.400 --> 08:16.700]  that how the GUI of the Apache J meter exactly looks\n",
            "[08:16.700 --> 08:19.700]  like now a complete test plan consists of one\n",
            "[08:19.700 --> 08:23.400]  or more elements such as the thread groups logic controllers\n",
            "[08:23.400 --> 08:25.900]  sample generating controllers Etc.\n",
            "[08:25.900 --> 08:28.500]  It describes the behavior of the element.\n",
            "[08:28.500 --> 08:31.700]  Now once we configure the element we just save it\n",
            "[08:31.700 --> 08:33.300]  then we run the test plan\n",
            "[08:33.300 --> 08:37.500]  and analyze the test result from various graphical formats\n",
            "[08:37.500 --> 08:41.800]  such as tree table and graph now it is quite difficult\n",
            "[08:41.800 --> 08:45.400]  for humans to execute performance testing manually.\n",
            "[08:45.400 --> 08:46.800]  So it is inevitable\n",

            "[09:03.900 --> 09:07.800]  So the first element is the thread group now thread groups\n",
            "[09:07.800 --> 09:12.200]  is a collection of threads each thread represents one user\n",
            "[09:12.200 --> 09:14.600]  using the application under test.\n",

            "[14:31.500 --> 14:32.700]  like a container\n",

            "[14:37.100 --> 14:40.700]  So any kind of graph results samplers listeners anything\n",
            "[14:40.700 --> 14:42.700]  will come under the test plan.\n",
            "[14:42.800 --> 14:45.900]  So let's just give it a name as Ed Eureka.\n",
            "[14:46.700 --> 14:48.300]  So here I've changed the name\n",
            "[14:48.300 --> 14:50.000]  and as soon as you click here,\n",

            "[14:56.700 --> 15:00.300]  so you can see a lot of elements that we can add here.\n",
            "[15:00.300 --> 15:03.300]  So one of the most important ones is the threads.\n",
            "[15:03.300 --> 15:05.900]  So we have discussed about the thread group.\n",
            "[15:06.200 --> 15:08.700]  So we know that the thread group is basically\n",

            "[15:22.300 --> 15:26.100]  So here we have action to be taken after a sampler error.\n",
            "[15:26.100 --> 15:27.800]  So what it basically means is\n",
            "[15:27.800 --> 15:30.200]  that is asking what should the thread do\n",
            "[15:30.200 --> 15:31.300]  if there's an error\n",
            "[15:31.300 --> 15:34.000]  that has occurred while performing the test.\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:35.300]  So here we have options\n",
            "[15:35.300 --> 15:37.300]  like we can continue with our test\n",
            "[15:37.300 --> 15:39.700]  or start next thread loop stop thread\n",
            "[15:39.700 --> 15:41.000]  or stop the test.\n",

            "[15:48.200 --> 15:50.100]  of the most important part here.\n",
            "[15:50.100 --> 15:53.800]  We have number of threads ramp up period in seconds\n",
            "[15:53.800 --> 15:55.000]  and the loop count\n",
            "[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  like if you want to count it forever\n",
            "[15:57.000 --> 15:59.400]  or for some particular number of loops.\n",
            "[15:59.600 --> 16:01.800]  So as of now all the values are one\n",
            "[16:01.800 --> 16:05.800]  so we have one thread one ramp up period and one loop count.\n",
            "[16:05.800 --> 16:09.200]  Now, let's go back and add a sampler now.\n",
            "[16:09.200 --> 16:10.500]  So we already know\n",
            "[16:10.500 --> 16:14.400]  that J meter supports testing HTTP FTP and all\n",
            "[16:14.400 --> 16:17.900]  that and the sampler is another important element\n",

            "[16:19.100 --> 16:22.600]  So here let's add another HTTP request.\n",
            "[16:22.900 --> 16:26.900]  So the HTTP request will let you send an HTTP\n",
            "[16:26.900 --> 16:30.100]  or HTTPS request to a web server.\n",
            "[16:30.800 --> 16:34.000]  So we will be running a web application here.\n",
